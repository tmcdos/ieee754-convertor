# IEEE-754 converter

### Decoding floating point numbers from binary IEEE-754 ###

----------

This little tool decodes:

1. **Single**, **Double** and **Extended** precision floating point numbers from their binary representation (both Little-Endian and Big-Endian) into their decimal exponential representation
2. 16-byte GUIDs from their binary representation (both Little-Endian and Big-Endian) into their normal textual representation
3. Delphi **TDateTime** values in Big-Endian to their human-readable textual representation
